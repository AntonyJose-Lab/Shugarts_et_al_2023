This paper describes the analysis of RNA seqeuncing data from wild-type and sid-1(-) animals to identidty sid-1-dependent genes (sdg). It also compares tables generated from a few past studies on RNA silencing that examined changes in mRNA and small RNA levels to identify changes in sdg-1 and sdg-2, if any.

Scripts:

  differential_expression_analysis_example.R
  sdg-1_and_sdg-2_in_past_studies.R

Details for each step are commented on within the scripts. Modify paths as required before use.
