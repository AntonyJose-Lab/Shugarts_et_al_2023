This paper describes the analysis of RNA sequencing data from wild-type and <i>sid-1(-)</i> animals to identify <i>sid-1</i>-dependent genes (<i>sdg</i>). It also compares 21 published datasets from a few past studies on RNA silencing that examined changes in mRNA and small RNA levels to identify changes in <i>sdg-1</i> and <i>sdg-2</i>, if any.

Each step is commented on within the scripts. Modify paths as required before use.
